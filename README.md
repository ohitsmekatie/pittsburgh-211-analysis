# pittsburgh-211-analysis

The goal of the analysis is to look at the WPRDC dataset on 211 calls within Allegheny County, Pennsylvania specifically to try to identify areas where volunteer outreach programs would make the most impact within these three categories:

* Hunger / food scarcity
* Basic utility access
* Housing access (people without homes)
