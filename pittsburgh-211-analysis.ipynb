    "The goal of the analysis is to look at the [WPRDC dataset on 211 calls](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/211-requests) within Allegheny County, Pennsylvania specifially to try to identify areas where volunteer outreach programs would make the most impact within these three categories:\n",

    "1. Hunger / food scarcity \n",
    "2. Basic utility access \n",
    "3. Housing access (people without homes)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Every day, thousands of people in our region are struggling to put food on the table, keep the lights on, and keep a roof over their head. 2-1-1 is a 24/7 telephone helpline (also available via text and chat) that helps prevent hunger, utility shut-offs and homelessness when people have nowhere else to turn. During each call, our Resource Navigators skillfully identify an individualâ€™s immediate needs and connect them to services and resources that address the full spectrum of needs discovered through a thoughtful and compassionate conversation."
